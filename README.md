# Kickstarter-analysis
### Purpose
- Following the client, Louise’s play Fever coming close to it’s fundraising goal in a short amount of time. The purpose of this study was to analyze the outcomes of various Kickstarter campaigns in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. The following charts provide a visual representation of the dataset provided.

Using theater as a sub-data set, the above chart reflects a correlation between the outcomes of theater campaigns in relation their launch date. Most theater campaigns launching in May are successful, however there are failed theater campaigns during May and October. Interestingly, the amount of successful campaign launch dates and failed launch dates are at a close equilibrium during December as shown from how close they are intersecting. 

### Outcomes based on Goal

The above chart compares the outcomes of the theater campaigns in relative to their funding goals. Funding goals of less than $1,000 were the most successful with the least probability of failing. The failed campaigns are skewed to the left which shows that campaigns with larger funding goals were more probable to have failed. 
There were no challenges in extracting the information, however a possible challenge would be omitting the October launch date cancellations from the analysis. If the uncancelled campaigns were omitted, we also omit seeing one of the peak months for failed campaigns launches.

## Results
For the reasons above, theater campaign launches in the spring months were more successful than those in the fall. The summer months show the least number of cancellations for spring campaign launches. 
Theater campaigns with funding goals in the range of $45,000 to $49,999 have the least probability of succeeding and the most probability of failing. 
To improve any limitations in the analysis, incorporating the deadline as a variable can show whether having deadlines shorter or further from campaign launch dates contributed to their outcome.
